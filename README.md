## Introduction

Jokester is a fun and simple application built with React that fetches joke categories using a custom hook. It utilizes the Chuck Norris Jokes API to retrieve a list of joke categories and displays them in the UI. When a user clicks on a category, a modal dialogue opens with a spinner animation, indicating that the app is fetching a random joke related to the selected category. The fetched joke is then displayed in the modal dialogue. The "Next" button allows users to fetch and display the next joke within the same category.
